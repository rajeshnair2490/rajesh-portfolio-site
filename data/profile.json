  "about": "Engineering leader focused on distributed systems, runtime observability, and performance at scale. I design for clarity—instrumentation-first services with traceability, metrics, and log correlation so teams can reason about behavior in production. Experience spans Java/Spring, C/C++, and platform work across Linux/AIX. I enjoy turning product goals into scalable architectures, building dashboards that expose bottlenecks, and driving reliability through SLOs and continuous feedback loops.",
